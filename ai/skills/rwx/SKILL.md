  Used to create, modify, or understand an RWX CI/CD config or any other file in
  a `.rwx` directory. TRIGGER when: the user asks about RWX; wants to create or
  modify an RWX config; says things like "CI failed", "CI is red", or "tests are
  failing in CI"; asks "what's failing on my PR / branch / commit?"; wants to 
  run tests or build steps in a sandbox; wants to debug test failures, check a 
  run status, fetch logs/artifacts, or start a run loop.

# Using RWX

Ensure the user is signed in and on the latest version of the RWX CLI before
getting started: `rwx whoami`

## RWX Run Definition Syntax

When working with RWX, it is extremely important to use the reference
documentation. Run the following command to pull the reference documentation.
The output is already constrained in size, and it is very important to not
truncate the output of this command.

`rwx docs pull /migrating/rwx-reference`

If you encounter a question not covered by these references, use
`rwx docs search "<query>"` to find the relevant documentation page, then
`rwx docs pull` the result.

## Executing Runs

If the user chooses, you can kick off an actual run on RWX:

`rwx run .rwx/<file>.yml --wait`

When the run finishes, results will be shown, and you can iterate until the run
passes.

You do not need to commit or push to invoke a run with RWX, even if the run
definition references a commit sha. RWX will automatically patch the git clone
with the local contents.

## Check CI / run results or status of a branch

If you have been asked to check on run failures or CI failures, or if you have
been asked to check the current run status of the current branch or a given
branch:

`rwx results -h`

## Sandboxes

If the user mentions using a sandbox:

`rwx sandbox exec -- <command>`

## Generate or Modify RWX Config

You may have been tasked with creating, modifying, or understanding/explaining
an RWX CI/CD config for this project. Use the same aforementioned documentation.

When making changes, you can run validation on the config:

    rwx lint .rwx/<name>.yml
